**React Native Universal Settings Screen With Async Support & Spinner**

To my greatest surprise, `react-native`, unlike the native frameworks of iOS and Android, does not offer a standard ready-to-use `Settings` screen template.

It seems that the `react-native` developers have decided to leave those components to the community.
